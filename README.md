## Installation 🛠️

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DigiDARATechnologies/Infomate.git
cd Infomate/College_Infomate
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash

```

### 3. Install and Configure Ollama

- Download and install from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.com/).

  ```bash
  ollama pull mistral:latest
  ```
- Start the Ollama server:
  ```bash
  ollama serve
  ```

---

## Configuration ⚙️

- Ensure Ollama is running before starting the Flask app.

---

## Usage 🚀

### Start the Application

1. **Start Ollama server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
2. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - Access the web interface at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### CLI Mode (Optional)

python chat.py
```
- Enter questions at the prompt, type `quit` to exit.

---

## How it Works ⚡

- **Web Interface:** 🖥️ Flask serves the chatbot UI and contact form.
- **Chatbot Pipeline:** 🔍 User queries are embedded, relevant documents are searched locally, and Mistral generates answers.
- **Contact Form:** 📬 Submissions are processed and (optionally) stored or emailed.

## API Endpoints 🌐

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                                 |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`              | Serves the main web interface               |
| POST   | `/submit_contact`| Accepts contact form data (JSON response)   |
| POST   | `/chat`          | Accepts a message, returns chatbot response |

---

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Ollama Not Responding:** Ensure `ollama serve` is running and the model is pulled.
- **No Answers from Chatbot:** Ensure your local document data is available and properly indexed.
- **Flask Errors:** Check for missing templates or dependency issues.

---

## Future Improvements 🚧

- Store contact form submissions in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Email notifications for new inquiries
- Enhanced UI with CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)
- Multi-turn conversation support
- User authentication
