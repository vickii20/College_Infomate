# Chatbot Question Understanding Improvements

## Problem Identified
The original chatbot was having trouble understanding user questions properly, leading to poor responses and user frustration.

## Root Causes
1. **Limited Context Understanding**: The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model is designed for semantic similarity, not complex question understanding
2. **Poor Prompt Engineering**: Basic prompts didn't provide enough guidance for the LLM
3. **No Query Preprocessing**: Raw user queries were used without cleaning or enhancement
4. **Limited Retrieval**: Only 5 documents were retrieved, insufficient for complex questions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Query Preprocessing (`QueryPreprocessor` class)
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalize case, remove special characters, handle whitespace
- **Keyword Extraction**: Use NLTK to extract meaningful keywords, remove stopwords, lemmatize
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically expand queries with related terms for better retrieval
- **Question Pattern Recognition**: Identify common question types and add relevant context

### 2. Enhanced Document Retrieval
- **Multi-Strategy Search**: Primary search + keyword-based fallback
- **Increased Context**: Retrieve 8 documents instead of 5
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate content to maximize information diversity
- **Keyword Fallback**: If primary search fails, use extracted keywords for secondary search

### 3. Improved Prompt Engineering
- **Structured Guidelines**: Clear instructions for the LLM on how to respond
- **Context Awareness**: Include extracted keywords in the prompt
- **Domain-Specific Guidance**: Specific instructions for different question types (admissions, courses, etc.)
- **Professional Tone**: Ensure consistent, helpful responses

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses when information is not available
- **User Guidance**: Suggest rephrasing or contacting the college directly
- **Detailed Logging**: Better debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Files Created

### 1. `improved_chat.py`
- Enhanced version using Qdrant vector database
- Includes all improvements mentioned above
- Better for production use with cloud vector storage

### 2. `improved_sample.py`
- Enhanced version using FAISS local vector database
- Same improvements as above
- Better for local development and testing

### 3. `requirements_improved.txt`
- Updated dependencies including NLTK for text processing
- All necessary packages for the improved functionality

## Key Features

### Query Preprocessing
```python
# Example of how queries are enhanced
Original: "admission"
Processed: {
    'cleaned': 'admission',
    'keywords': ['admission'],
    'expanded': ['admission', 'admission admission procedure', 'admission how to apply', ...]
}
```

### Enhanced Retrieval
- Primary search with original query
- Keyword-based fallback if insufficient results
- Deduplication to maximize information diversity
- Increased context window (8 documents vs 5)

### Better Prompts
- Structured guidelines for the LLM
- Domain-specific instructions
- Keyword context inclusion
- Professional tone requirements

## Usage

### For Qdrant-based system:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_improved.txt
python improved_chat.py
```

### For FAISS-based system:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_improved.txt
python improved_sample.py
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Question Understanding**: Preprocessing helps identify user intent
2. **More Relevant Responses**: Enhanced retrieval provides better context
3. **Consistent Quality**: Structured prompts ensure reliable responses
4. **User-Friendly**: Better error messages and guidance
5. **Maintainable**: Better logging and error handling

## Testing Recommendations

Test the improved chatbot with various question types:
- Simple questions: "What courses are available?"
- Complex questions: "How do I apply for admission and what are the requirements?"
- Ambiguous questions: "Tell me about the college"
- Specific questions: "What is the contact number for the CSE department?"

The improved system should handle all these question types much better than the original version.
