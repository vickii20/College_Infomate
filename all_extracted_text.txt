A Grievance Redressal Cell has been constituted in Kongunadu College of Engineering & Technology in accordance with the regulations of University Grants Commission. OBJECTIVES To maintain a fair, unbiased, and consistent system for redressal of various issues faced by the students. To ensure strict confidentiality so that students approach the Grievance Redressal Cell without the fear of any vindictive activity. To maintain a conducive atmosphere and relationship between the students and faculty without giving any chance to widen the gap between them that may arise because of certain simple misunderstandings. To ascertain that immediate suitable actions are taken by addressing the faculty or by requesting the management depending upon the nature of the grievance. Mechanism of Grievances and Redressal Cell The Grievance Redressal Cell has been formed solely to provide solutions for the grievances of the students which arise then and there. The students drop their grievance letters in the suggestion boxes provided in our campus or send online to the email [email protected] . The grievances dropped in the suggestion boxes are collected periodically and they are analysed by the committee and forwarded to the concerned department for remarks. After receiving the remarks, the committee discusses about them, takes suitable actions to solve the grievances if found genuine. On receipt of the grievances the Grievance Redressal Cell scrutinizes, analyzes carefully and discusses with the concerned person to find out on amicable solution without affecting the interests of both the parties. The students are fully free to submit their grievances regarding academic or personal matters in the meeting. A formal review meeting will be convened to deliberate the proceedings of the grievance received from the student. If the grievances are pertaining to the decision of the management, the committee will submit a report to the management with its remarks or recommendations. If the grievances are found to be not reasonable, the students are explained about the impossibilities to implement them. In all cases maintaining strict confidentiality is ensured by the Grievance Redressal Cell.

A Grievance Redressal Cell has been constituted in Kongunadu College of Engineering & Technology in accordance with the regulations of University Grants Commission. OBJECTIVES To maintain a fair, unbiased, and consistent system for redressal of various issues faced by the students. To ensure strict confidentiality so that students approach the Grievance Redressal Cell without the fear of any vindictive activity. To maintain a conducive atmosphere and relationship between the students and faculty without giving any chance to widen the gap between them that may arise because of certain simple misunderstandings. To ascertain that immediate suitable actions are taken by addressing the faculty or by requesting the management depending upon the nature of the grievance. Mechanism of Grievances and Redressal Cell The Grievance Redressal Cell has been formed solely to provide solutions for the grievances of the students which arise then and there. The students drop their grievance letters in the suggestion boxes provided in our campus or send online to the email [email protected] . The grievances dropped in the suggestion boxes are collected periodically and they are analysed by the committee and forwarded to the concerned department for remarks. After receiving the remarks, the committee discusses about them, takes suitable actions to solve the grievances if found genuine. On receipt of the grievances the Grievance Redressal Cell scrutinizes, analyzes carefully and discusses with the concerned person to find out on amicable solution without affecting the interests of both the parties. The students are fully free to submit their grievances regarding academic or personal matters in the meeting. A formal review meeting will be convened to deliberate the proceedings of the grievance received from the student. If the grievances are pertaining to the decision of the management, the committee will submit a report to the management with its remarks or recommendations. If the grievances are found to be not reasonable, the students are explained about the impossibilities to implement them. In all cases maintaining strict confidentiality is ensured by the Grievance Redressal Cell. Composition of Grievances and Redressal Cell A Grievance Redressal Committee has been re-constituted for the academic year 2022-2023 with the following faculty members to address the complaints and suggestions received from the student. 2024 - 2025 2023 - 2024 2024 - 2025 S.No Name Member Address Membership 1 Dr. R.

Title of the Practice: Academic Result Improvement through effective mentoring 2. Goal To achieve good academic results and improve the quality of the rural students admitted in the college through this best practice. 3. The Context For every institution academic result is the key factor. Our college is located in rural area and 60 to 70 of the students admitted are from rural background and are the first graduates in their family. The medium of instruction of the engineering course is English and since most of the students are from Tamil medium, they feel difficult to understand the classes and write the examination in English. To brainstorm and remove the fear from the students? mind, this practice is followed. Hence the academic results are improved. 4. The Practice Bridge course is conducted to the students to understand the objective of the programme and its scope. The regulation of the programme and made them to realized the excel in their skills by utilizing the curriculum will be discussed in detail in this course. After the bridge course, Orientation programme is conducted to the students before their regular classes. During the regular class, daily two topics are given to the students to prepare for the test besides their regular class work. Daily morning one hour is allotted to write the test in the given topics. If they score less mark and are unable to understand the concept clearly, they are provided with additional classes beyond the working hours, to clarify their doubts with the subject teacher and also necessary counselling is given to the students. Since, the individual attention is given to the students, they feel comfortable and their performance is appreciable in the tests. As a result, the students have a good understanding of the subject and they succeed in the terminal and the university examinations. 5. Evidence of Success In reviewing the students? results after the first semester, it is noticeable that their performance is better than that of the initial stage. This is reflected consecutively in the university examination results. Our college stands the 14th place among 506 Anna University affiliated colleges.

Title of the Practice: Academic Result Improvement through effective mentoring 2. Goal To achieve good academic results and improve the quality of the rural students admitted in the college through this best practice. 3. The Context For every institution academic result is the keyfactor. Our college is located in rural area and 60 to 70 of the students admitted are from rural background and are the first graduates in their family. The medium of instruction of the engineering course is English and since most of the students are from Tamil medium, they feel difficult to understand the classes and write the examination in English. To brainstorm and remove the fear from the students? mind, this practice is followed. Hence the academic results are improved. 4. The Practice Bridge course is conducted to the students to understand the objective of the programme and its scope. The regulation of the programme and made them to realized the excel in their skills by utilizing the curriculum will be discussed in detail in this course. After the bridge course, Orientation programme is conducted to the students before their regular classes. During the regular class, daily two topics are given to the students to prepare for the test besides their regular class work. Daily morning one hour is allotted to write the test in the given topics. If they score less mark and are unable to understand the concept clearly, they are provided with additional classes beyond the working hours, to clarify their doubts with the subject teacher and also necessary counselling is given to the students. Since, the individual attention is given to the students, they feel comfortable and their performance is appreciable in the tests. As a result, the students have a good understanding of the subject and they succeed in the terminal and the university examinations. 5. Evidence of Success In reviewing the students? results after the first semester, it is noticeable that their performance is better than that of the initial stage. This is reflected consecutively in the university examination results. Our college stands the 14th place among 506 Anna University affiliated colleges.
